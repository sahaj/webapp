  Project Overview
In this project, we study the impact of “experts” in crowdsourcing systems, in the context of SeekingAlpha and StockTwits, two crowdsourced investment services that are encroaching on a space dominated for decades by large investment banks. We seek to understand the quality and impact of content on crowdsourcing investment platforms, by empirically analyzing complete datasets of SeekingAlpha articles (9 years) and StockTwits messages (4 years). 
<li>
<ul>
  We develop sentiment analysis tools and correlate contributed content to the historical performance of relevant stocks. We find that while SeekingAlpha articles and StockTwits messages provide minimal correlation to stock performance in aggregate, a subset of experts contribute more valuable (predictive) content. 
</ul>
<ul>
  We show these experts can be identified by user interactions. We develop a simple stock investment strategy based on experts’ sentiments, which significantly outperforms broader markets. 
</ul>
<ul>
  Finally, we conduct a user survey that sheds light on users views of SeekingAlpha content and stock manipulation.
</ul>
